#### **1.4 Weather Forecast:**
- **Weather API Integration**: Integrate with a reliable weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).
- **Location-based Forecast**: Provide weather updates based on user-specified locations.
- **Daily Forecast Summary**: Send users the weather forecast for the day (or week).

#### **1.5 Notification System:**
- **Email Notifications**: Use email service providers like SendGrid, AWS SES, or Mailgun to send daily emails.
- **SMS Notifications**: Integrate with SMS providers like Twilio for sending SMS notifications.
- **Push Notifications (Optional)**: For mobile or web apps, use push notification services for real-time updates.

#### **1.6 Admin Dashboard:**
- **User Management**: View and manage users, their preferences, and subscription status.
- **Content Management**: Manually curate or adjust content for news and movie recommendations.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Track metrics such as user engagement, open rates, and subscription trends.

### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **2.1 Performance:**
- **Scalability**: The system should handle multiple users subscribing to the service, possibly scaling to thousands of users receiving daily updates simultaneously.
- **Low Latency**: The system should fetch data from APIs quickly, ensuring the daily summaries are delivered on time.
  
#### **2.2 Security:**
- **Data Protection**: Ensure user data (especially personal information like emails and phone numbers) is securely stored and encrypted.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement secure login systems for users and admin (JWT, OAuth).
- **API Security**: Secure API keys and endpoints to avoid unauthorized access.

#### **2.3 Availability and Reliability:**
- **High Uptime**: Ensure the service is highly available, with minimal downtime, as it involves daily delivery.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backups of user data and preferences.
  
#### **2.4 Usability:**
- **Easy Signup Process**: Ensure that signing up and setting preferences is user-friendly.
- **Customizable Notifications**: Users should have an easy way to update their preferences (news topics, movie genres, locations, etc.).

#### **2.5 Maintainability**: 
- **Modular Design**: The application should be modular, making it easy to add new features like additional services (e.g., stock market updates).
- **API Updates**: Regularly update integrated APIs for news, movies, and weather.

### **3. Technical Requirements**

#### **3.1 Backend:**
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Node.js, or any backend framework that can easily integrate with external APIs and schedule tasks.
- **API Integrations**:
  - **News**: NewsAPI, Google News API
  - **Movies**: TMDb API, OMDb API
  - **Weather**: OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI
- **Database**: Store user preferences, subscriptions, and logs of notifications sent.
  - **SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)** or **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)** depending on the complexity.
- **Task Scheduling**: Use tools like `cron` jobs or **Celery** (for Python) to schedule daily notifications.

#### **3.2 Frontend:**
- **User Interface**: If you're building a web or mobile app:
  - **Responsive Web Application**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js, Angular.js, Vue.js).
  - **Mobile App (Optional)**: React Native, Flutter, or native Android/iOS apps for push notifications and better user interaction.

#### **3.3 DevOps:**
- **Cloud Hosting**: Host the service on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
- **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration and delivery pipelines for faster deployments.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Use tools like **New Relic**, **Prometheus**, or **Grafana** for performance monitoring and alerting on failures.

### **4. External Services and APIs**

1. **News APIs**:
   - **NewsAPI**: Provides a wide range of articles based on topics.
   - **Google News API**: Delivers more specific news categories and regions.
  
2. **Movie Recommendation APIs**:
   - **TMDb API**: A rich database of movie recommendations.
   - **OMDb API**: Provides metadata about movies and TV shows.

3. **Weather APIs**:
   - **OpenWeatherMap**: Provides current weather, forecasts, and historical data.
   - **WeatherAPI**: Offers robust features for weather data.

4. **Email and SMS Services**:
   - **SendGrid**, **Mailgun**, or **AWS SES** for email services.
   - **Twilio** for SMS notifications.

5. **Push Notification Service**:
   - **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for mobile/web app push notifications.
   - **OneSignal** for cross-platform notifications.

### **5. User Experience Flow**

1. **Sign-Up**:
   - User signs up and selects subscription preferences.
   - User can opt for one or more services (news, movie recommendations, weather).

2. **Daily Workflow**:
   - The system fetches data from the APIs early in the day (e.g., 6 AM).
   - A personalized daily summary is generated based on user preferences.
   - Notifications are sent to users via their selected channels (email, SMS, or push notifications).

3. **Admin Workflow**:
   - Admin can view all users and their preferences.
   - Admin can manually send or curate content if needed.

### **6. Potential Challenges**

- **API Rate Limits**: Handle API rate limits effectively, especially for free-tier services.
- **Content Filtering**: Ensuring that news content or movie recommendations are appropriate based on user preferences and region.
- **Data Privacy**: Protect user data in compliance with regulations like GDPR.
